## Testing

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the Dockerfile generator, we have included a comprehensive test suite. The tests cover prompts, input validation, file generation, and error handling, verifying that the generator behaves as expected in various scenarios and edge cases.

### Installation

Before running the tests, ensure that you have Node.js, npm and mocha installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:`

`git clone https://github.com/DiogoAngelim/generator-dockerfile.git`

 2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd generator-dockerfile`

 3. Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

### Running tests

Once the dependencies are installed, enter the tests directory and run mocha with the following command:

`mocha`

 This command will execute the entire test suite and provide feedback on the test results. Make sure all tests pass before making any contributions or modifications to the generator.
